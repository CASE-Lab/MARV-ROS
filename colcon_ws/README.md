# Colcon Workspace for MARV Project

## VS Code setup

A good way for development on the system via remote connection is to use [SSH Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh). Getting working autocomplete and linting working for rclpy and other packages is also not trivial but hopefulle the configuration added in .vscode should already work.

Some useful extensions are:

* Python and Pylance by Microsoft
* ROS by Microsoft (provides build commands and beta debugging)
* DBC Language Syntax (helps when reading CAN DBC files)
* Gitlense (who did what when?)
